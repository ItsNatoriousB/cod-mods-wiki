# Using Cordycep with Greyhound

{% include alert.html title="Note" type="info" content="Make sure to follow the initial guide for [Using Cordycep](/docs/cordycep/using_cordycep)." %}

Cordycep by itself is not an extraction tool and only handles making use of executable dumps to handle loading content. All asset extraction must still be done using pre-existing tools.

Using Greyhound with Cordycep is no different to using Greyhound with a running game as Cordycep emulates the game and tools such as Greyhound to load from it.

To start, ensure you've followed the [Using Cordycep](/docs/cordycep/using_cordycep) page to load files. Once done, you can simply click `Load Game` in Greyhound to load assets and export just like before, maintaining your pre-existing workflows.

{% include alert.html title="Note" type="info" content="When you load and unload files, make sure to click `Load Game` to refresh the asset list." %}

If you've followed everything correctly, you should end up with Cordycep having files loaded and Greyhound showing assets loaded for that particular title:
